AudioSlider
============

**NAMESPACE:**
   `UnityUtils.ScriptUtils.Audio`
   
The **AudioSlider** is a script you can apply onto a slider object to have it automatically work with the AudioManager script's volume types.
You can select the type of volume it will change, and it will change that volume when the slider gets updated.

.. tip::

   Add a :doc:`UIButtonHoverExpand` to the handle of the slider to have a small expanding animation!
