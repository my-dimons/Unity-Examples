.. note::

   This install method will change soon, as I will be moving to the unity package manager soon.
   
To install Unity Utils, first go to the (GitHub)[https://github.com/my-dimons/Unity-Utils/tree/main].
Then download the repository as a .zip, or download the specific files you want (Find Script Utils (here)[https://github.com/my-dimons/Unity-Utils/tree/main/Unity%20Utils/Assets/Script%20Utils]).
Finally either load the downloaded project into Unity, or copy the selected files into your unity project
